# Cart Functionality Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Quantity Update Issue
**Problem**: Add to cart button was not updating the quantity display properly
**Solution**: 
- Fixed UserDashboard to use centralized cart context methods instead of duplicating cart logic
- Replaced manual cart state management with `addToCart`, `updateQuantity`, and `getItemQuantity` from CartContext
- Ensured consistent state updates across all components

### 2. Guest Cart Merging Issue
**Problem**: Guest cart items were not properly merged with user cart on login
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `syncGuestCartToDatabase` method to check for existing items in user cart
- Implemented proper merging logic that adds quantities for duplicate items
- Fixed cart syncing to use `userId` instead of `username`
- Updated Login component to use CartContext for syncing

### 3. Storage Key Consistency
**Problem**: Different components were using different localStorage keys
**Solution**:
- Standardized all components to use `STORAGE_KEYS.GUEST_CART` ('guestCart')
- Fixed GuestProducts and other components to use consistent storage keys

## Key Changes Made

### Backend
1. **Fixed compilation errors**:
   - Updated UserAddressController to use UserService for getting User entities
   - Fixed ProductService to use `getVariants()` instead of `getSizes()`
   - Updated UserPreferencesService to use User entity and proper DTO conversion
   - Fixed all controllers to use `collect(Collectors.toList())` for Java 11 compatibility
   - Created missing UserPreferencesDTO class

### Frontend
1. **CartManager improvements**:
   - Enhanced guest cart syncing with proper merging logic
   - Fixed cart item comparison logic for variants
   - Improved error handling

2. **UserDashboard refactoring**:
   - Removed duplicate cart logic
   - Used centralized CartContext methods
   - Fixed wishlist API calls

3. **Login integration**:
   - Added proper cart syncing on login
   - Used CartContext instead of direct API calls

## How It Works Now

### Guest User Flow
1. User browses products without login
2. Adds items to cart (stored in localStorage as 'guestCart')
3. Quantity updates work properly with + and - buttons
4. Cart persists across page refreshes

### Login Flow
1. User logs in with items in guest cart
2. System fetches existing user cart from database
3. Merges guest cart items with existing user cart:
   - If item already exists: adds quantities together
   - If item is new: adds as new cart item
4. Clears guest cart from localStorage
5. Updates cart display with merged items

### Logged-in User Flow
1. All cart operations sync with database
2. Cart state managed through CartContext
3. Quantity updates reflect immediately in UI
4. Cart persists across sessions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Guest Cart**: Add items as guest, verify quantities update correctly
2. **Login Merge**: Add items as guest, login, verify items are merged properly
3. **Duplicate Items**: Add same item as guest and logged-in user, verify quantities merge
4. **Variants**: Test with products that have size/price variants
5. **Cross-session**: Verify cart persists after browser refresh/restart
