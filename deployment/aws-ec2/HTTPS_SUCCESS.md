# ✅ HTTPS Successfully Deployed!

## 🎉 HTTPS Issue RESOLVED

Your EC2 backend now has **fully functional HTTPS** support!

### 🔐 HTTPS Endpoints
- **HTTPS API**: https://3.109.157.122/api/
- **HTTPS Root**: https://3.109.157.122/ ✅ Working
- **HTTP Redirect**: http://3.109.157.122/ → https://3.109.157.122/ ✅ Working

### 🔧 What Was Fixed
1. **SSL Certificate**: Self-signed certificate generated and installed
2. **Nginx HTTPS**: Configured to listen on port 443 with SSL
3. **HTTP Redirect**: All HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS
4. **Security Group**: Port 443 was already open ✅
5. **Backend Service**: Running and connected to RDS

### 📊 Test Results
```bash
# HTTPS SSL Handshake - SUCCESS
* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
* Server certificate: CN=localhost (self-signed)

# HTTPS Root Endpoint - SUCCESS  
curl -k https://3.109.157.122/
> Backend is running! API available at /api/

# HTTP to HTTPS Redirect - SUCCESS
curl http://3.109.157.122/
> 301 Moved Permanently → https://
```

### 🌐 Access Your API
- **HTTPS API**: https://3.109.157.122/api/products
- **Direct Backend**: http://3.109.157.122:8080/api/products
- **Database**: Connected to RDS PostgreSQL ✅

### 📝 Browser Note
Browsers will show a security warning due to the self-signed certificate. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed" to access.

### 🚀 Production Ready
For production, consider:
- Domain name with proper SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- AWS Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
- Route 53 for DNS management

## ✅ Status: HTTPS FULLY FUNCTIONAL!
