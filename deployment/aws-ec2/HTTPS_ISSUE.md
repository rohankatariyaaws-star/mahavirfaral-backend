# HTTPS Issue on EC2

## Current Status
- ❌ HTTPS (port 443): Connection refused
- ✅ HTTP (port 80): Working but returns 403
- ✅ Direct backend (port 8080): Working perfectly

## Root Cause
The current EC2 instance was deployed without HTTPS configuration. The nginx configuration only listens on port 80.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use HTTP for now
Your backend is fully functional via HTTP:
- **HTTP API**: http://65.0.21.120/api/products (needs nginx proxy fix)
- **Direct API**: http://65.0.21.120:8080/api/products (working)

### Option 2: Deploy new instance with HTTPS
The updated `deploy-complete.sh` script now includes:
- Self-signed SSL certificate generation
- HTTPS nginx configuration
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect

Run the deployment script in a new AWS environment to get HTTPS working.

### Option 3: Manual HTTPS setup (requires SSH access)
```bash
# SSH into the instance
ssh -i mahavirfaral-ec2-key.pem ec2-user@65.0.21.120

# Create SSL certificate
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout /etc/ssl/private/selfsigned.key \
  -out /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned.crt \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"

# Update nginx config for HTTPS
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
# (Add HTTPS server block)

# Reload nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Recommendation
For production use, consider:
1. Using a proper domain name
2. Setting up Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
3. Using AWS Application Load Balancer with SSL termination

## Current Working Endpoints
- **Direct Backend**: http://65.0.21.120:8080/api/products ✅
- **Products API**: Returns JSON data with products ✅
- **Database**: Connected to RDS PostgreSQL ✅
